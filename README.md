# Digitalocean droplet creator
Creates, destroys and maintains droplets using the python API. 
Mainly used to learn about cloud automation, ansible and docker as a hobby project.

# Usage
* ./setup create <name>

# Main Features
* Create
* Destroy
* List 

# Requirements
* python-digitalocean
* ansible - apt
* HoneyD - https://github.com/DataSoft/Honeyd

# Todo
* Make the honeypot actually work in docker. Tested with SimpleHTTPServer to make sure any port can be reached. The honeypot works a little differently tho, as it mimics the hardwares network adapters and attempts to register as a new IP.

* Honeynet project - https://www.honeynet.org/

# No, I'm not using Vagrant
